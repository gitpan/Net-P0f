Net-P0f
=======

DESCRIPTION

    This module is a wrapper for the P0f utility. Tthree back-ends are 
    provided, to make it work on the largest set of systems. 

     o Command line front-end: You only need to install the P0f utility. 
       Should work on all systems where P0f works. 

     o Socket version: You only need to install the P0f utility. 
       Works only on systems with Unix-socket support.

     o XS version: You need the headers for the Pcap library (usually 
       provided in a package called libpcap-devel), and of course a 
       C compiler.
